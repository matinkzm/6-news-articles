# 6-news-articles

this is 6th project from this link: https://medium.com/@luisprooc/30-data-engineering-project-ideas-9ecf0a70cbea

In this project I used an api to get article news titles from this site: https://newsapi.org/
(it has a free api key)

add date and time to news and write it to a csv file

because it adds some unwanted double quotes I wrote the data into another file and remove the double quotes.
